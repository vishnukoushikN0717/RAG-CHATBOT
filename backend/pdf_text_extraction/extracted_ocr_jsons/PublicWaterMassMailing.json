Box 570, Jefferson City, MO 65102-0570 Phone: 573-751-6400 FAX: 573-751-6010\nRELAY MISSOURI for Hearing and Speech Impaired 1-800-735-2966 VOICE 1-800-735-2466\n\nPeter Lyskowski Jeremiah W. (Jay) Nixon\nActing Director Governor\n\nMissouri Public Water Systems\n\nNovember 10, 2015\n\nDear Public Water System Owners/Operators:\n\nThe Missouri State Public Health Laboratory (MSPHL) is in the process of implementing a new\nLaboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in its drinking water bacteriology testing\nlaboratory. The OpenELIS (OE) LIMS will provide the laboratory with improved sample management\ncapability, improved data integrity and reduced potential for human data entry error. In addition, the\nsystem will provide improved reporting capabilities, including direct electronic data exchange with the\nMissouri Department of Natural Resources’ (MDNR) Safe Drinking Water Information System\n(SDWIS). SDWIS is the computer system MDNR uses to store regulatory water testing data and report\ntesting results to you and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the new OE LIMS will\nprovide a web portal that MSPHL clients can use to access their own test results in real time.\n\nAs the MSPHL implements this new computer system, several changes will be made in the way you\ncollect and submit water samples for testing. This letter and information packet will provide you with\ninformation to help educate you on these changes.\n\nNEW SAMPLE BOTTLES:\n\nBeginning in August 2015, the MSPHL began using a larger sample bottle for water bacterial testing.\nThis bottle has a shrink wrap seal and two lines to indicate the proper sample volume. Please read the\nattached “SAMPLE COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS? for details on how to use these new bottles,\nSample volume MUST be within the two lines on the bottle (100 — 120 mL) to be acceptable for\ntesting. You may continue to use your old bottles until the MSPHL can ship you new ones. Once you\nhave received the new bottles, please discard or recycle the old bottles.\n\nNEW SAMPLE INFORMATION FORMS:\n\nThe traditional sample information “card” that has been used for more than twenty years is being\nreplaced by the Environmental Sample Collection Form. An example form is attached. Please read the\nattached instructions for information on properly completing the new form.\n\nChanges to the form include the following:\n\n1. Form size is expanded to a single 8 %” x 11” sheet of paper. The form is no longer in a triplicate\ncarbon copy format. You may choose to photocopy for your records if you prefer. Note: MDNR\ndoes not require a public water system to retain copies of sample collection forms: however, you\nmight utilize them for system inspections.\n\n2. The form is printed by the OE LIMS and will be pre-populated with your Public Water Supply\nID number, PWS name, address and county. Forms should not be shared with other supplies.\n\nwww.health.mo.gov\n\nHealthy Missourians for life.\nThe Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services will be the leader in promoting, protecting and partnering for health.\n\nAN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY / AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EMPLOYER: Services provided on a nondiscriminatory basis."

        "content": "Contract operators will be provided with forms for all the supplies they operate. Blank forms will\nbe available for MDNR Regional Office staff use.\n\n3. The form requires all requested information to be printed by the collector. There are no longer\ncheck boxes for Sample Type or Repeat Location.\n\n4. Facility ID, Sample Collection Point ID and Location for the sampling site MUST be\nprovided by the collector. This information is available from your MDNR approved PWS\nsampling plan. MDNR will be providing all public water systems with a current copy of their\napproved sampling plan. This information is required by SDWIS and is used by MDNR to\nensure regulatory compliance requirements have been met. Failure to complete this information\non the sample collection form may result in a non-compliance report from MDNR.\n\n5. A Collector Signature line has been added. The sample collector must sign the form to attest the\ninformation provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge.\n\nThe MSPHL will begin shipping the new forms to public water systems in late November or early\nDecember. Please begin using the new forms December 16, 2015. Discard all the old forms (“cards”)\nat that time.\n\nNEW SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nSample instructions have been revised to include changes to the bottle and sampling form. The\ninstructions include detailed information on how to collect the sample using the new bottle, how to\ncomplete the new sample collection form, how to best ship samples to the MSPHL using the free\nMSPHL courier system, and how to register for the new MSPHL web portal. A copy of these\ninstructions is attached.\n\nNEW WEB PORTAL FOR RESULTS REPORTS\n\nThe OE LIMS provides a web portal that may be used by systems to view and print their test result\nreports, check status of samples, download sample information into Excel, and receive automated emails\nwhen samples are received at the laboratory, and when sample results are ready to be viewed. For\ninformation on how to gain access to this portal, please contact Shondra Johnson, LIMS Administrator\nat Shondra.Johnson@health.mo.gov or at 573-751-3334.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION DATES:\n\nThe MSPHL intends to implement the OpenELIS LIMS on December 1, 2015. There will be a two\nweek testing period in which laboratory staff will run the new LIMS in conjunction with our current\nmanual, paper-based system to ensure the OE LIMS is operating properly. You may continue to submit\nsamples as you currently do, using the old sample information card, throughout this time.\n\nOn December 16, 2015, the MSPHL plans to “go-live” with the new OE LIMS. Samples submitted\nafter that date should be submitted on the new Environmental Sample Collection Form. At that time, the\nMSPHL Test Results Web Portal will also be available to those systems that have been granted access.\n\nThe MSPHL and MDNR understand that there will be a lot of changes to a system that has been in place\nfor many years. The MSPHL is excited about the added benefits from this new system, and we ask for\nyour patience as we implement the OpenELIS LIMS at the Missouri State Public Health Laboratory."

Fill Line:\nMin, Fill Line\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\nBacteriological Sample Collection Procedures\n\nAssemble all of the sampling supplies. Before you begin, wash your hands\nthoroughly before handling supplies. Go to the sampling location(s) specified\nin your Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) approved\nsampling site plan. The sample should be taken from a clean, smooth-nosed cold\nwater faucet if possible. Avoid drinking fountains, leaky faucets, hot/cold\nmixing faucets and frost-proof yard hydrants since it is not practical to\nsterilize these fixtures. If possible, remove any aerators, strainers or hoses\nthat are present because they may harbor bacteria. Follow the procedures below\nwhen collecting the sample. Instructions for completing the environmental\nsampling form are on the following page.\n\n1. Open the cold water tap for about 3 minutes before collecting the sample.\nThis should adequately flush the water line of any debris.\n\n2. Flame-sterilize the tap and/or chemically disinfect the tap. Do not flame-\nsterilize if tap is plastic or if aerators are attached. Disinfect tap by\nthoroughly rinsing both the inside and outside of the tap with a mixture of 50%\nhouse-hold bleach (NaOCl) and 50% tap water. Take extreme care with strong\nbleach (oxidizing) solutions.\n\n3. Flush the tap for an additional 3 minutes with cold water, and then reduce\nto a gentle flow to about the width of a pencil. Do not change the water flow\nonce you have started sampling as this could dislodge contaminants in the tap.\n\n4, Remove the plastic shrink wrap seal by pulling down on the red strip and\npealing the shrink wrap from both the cap and bottle. Discard the shrink\nwrap. Do not attempt to reseal the lid with shrink wrap still attached.\n\n5. Grasp cap along top edge and remove carefully. Do not touch the inside\nwith your fingers. Hold the bottle in one hand and the cap in the other. Do not\nlay the cap down or put it in a pocket! Also, take care not to contaminate the\n\nsterile bottle or cap with your fingers or permit the faucet to touch the inside of\n\nthe bottle.\n\n6. Hold the bottle so that water entering the bottle will not come in contact with\nyour hands or the outside of the bottle.\n\n7. Fill the bottle until the water sample level is BETWEEN THE TWO\nLINES on the bottle (100 — 120 ml). Preferably, the sample level should be at\nor just slightly above the 100 ml line. Sample levels below the 100 ml (lower)\nline WILL NOT BE TESTED due to insufficient sample volume. Sample\nlevels above the 120 ml (upper) line WILL NOT BE TESTED due to\noverfilled bottle. If the bottle is overfilled, you may pour off any excess water\nto get the sample level between the two lines. Place the cap on the bottle and\nscrew it down tightly.\n\n8. Fill out the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS)\nState Public Health Lab (SPHL) Environmental Sample Collection Form\nusing waterproof ink. See attached document for instructions on properly\ncompleting the sample collection form and for shipping instructions.\n\n9. For single samples, neatly fold the sample collection form into thirds (standard\nletter fold), roll around the bottle and place in the shipping box. For multiple\nsamples, fold the forms once or more as needed, and place in the shipping box\nalongside the samples. If needed, use bubble pack or folded paper to fill space.\nDo not use shredded paper. Seal the box with a single strip of shipping tape and\naffix the return address label to the top of the box.\n\nFill sample bottle until water level is\nbetween the two lines on the bottle.\n\nFROST-PROOF HYDRANT\n\nt\nDO NOT USE.\n\nHOT-COLD MIXING FAUCET\n\nDO NOT USE.\n\nLAB 34 Public Water (R10-2015)"

The MSPHL and MDNR recommend you use the free Department of Health\nand Senior Services (DHSS) contract courier for overnight delivery to the MSPHL. This courier picks up at most local public health\nagency offices and hospitals (Note: Not all hospitals will accept water samples for courier pick up). For sample drop off locations and\ntimes, please go to http://www.health.mo.gov/lab/courierservices.php and click on the interactive map or the listing of drop off locations\nby county; or you may call the MSPHL courier liaison at (573) 751-4830, or the MDNR Public Drinking Water Branch (PD WB) at (573)\n526-1124.\n\nPlease note the courier is allowed to pick up samples within one hour of the scheduled time (before or after). The earliest pick up\ntime is at 10:30 a.m. To ensure your samples meet the transit time requirement of 30 hours, it is important that you collect your samples in\nthe morning and have them dropped off at the courier pickup point one hour prior to the scheduled time.\n\nUse of the U.S, Postal Service or other commercial carriers such as Fed Ex or UPS will require additional charges and may not meet the\n30 hour transit time requirement.\n\nSamples should not be en route to the laboratory over a weekend or state holiday (New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Day,\nLincoln’s Birthday, Washington’s Birthday, Truman’s Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veteran’s\nDay, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas.)\n\nPublic water supplies may use the new MSPHL Test Results Web Portal to retrieve preliminary test results on-line. For information on\nhow to register as a user for the web portal and to receive email notifications, please contact the MSPHL LIMS Administrator at\nshondra.johnson@health.mo.gov or call 573-751-3334. These preliminary test results are for informational purposes only. Official test\n\nresults are available on-line within 2 or 3 business days at the MDNR Drinking Water Watch website http://dnr.mo.gov/DWW/.\nIn addition, the official bacteriological sample reports will be mailed by MDNR within 4 or 5 business days.\n\nAdditional sample bottles can be ordered on-line at http://www.health.mo.gov/lab/specimentestforms.php or by calling the MSPHL\nCentral Services Unit at (573) 751-4830.\n\nSometimes in spite of taking all of the precautions you may get a call from MDNR or results by mail notifying you that coliform or\nE. coli bacteria are present in your water. You will be given specific instructions that may include collection of repeat samples to confirm\n\nthat the first routine sample was not a sampling error. Please call the MDNR Regional Office staff and they will discuss the procedure\nwith you.
