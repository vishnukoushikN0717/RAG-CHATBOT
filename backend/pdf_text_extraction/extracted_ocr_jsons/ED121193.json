Many Americans are already familiar with some aspects of the Open University\n(the only foreign case in the series) but the emphasis here is on its exemplary use of educational technology in context. A look at\nthe details of how the Open University employs media to serve a large dispersed student body may benefit others who plan to\nexpand or modify their own uses of educational technology. This report, written by Ruth Weinstock. research associate at EFL,\nand the other reports in this series are supported by a special grant to EFL from The Ford Foundation.\nPerhaps the most widely acclaimed nontraditional\nstudy program currently underway is the British Open\nUniversity. It has been described as \"the most ambitious\neffort yet known to harness the educational potential of\nradio and television, wed them to a system of\nindependent study, and organize the program as a\nformal degree-granting operation.\"'\nWithout a doubt, it offers one of the most complete\nexamples of educational technology in context.It\nemploys the most advanced and sophisticated multi-\nmedia instructional system in use anywhere to teach\nlarge numbers of remotely located students. The use of\nradio, television, computers, cassettes, and laboratory\nkits is integral to the instructional design. One of its\nmajor administrativedivisionSisan Instituteof\nEducational Technologyand through it, the use of\nmedia is thoughtfully developed to accomplish learning\nojectives. Indeed, the important role pleyed by the\n'Institute is expected to influence the direction of the\nUniversity itself. With regard to this, Armsey and Dahl\nobserve in their book on instructional technology that:\nThe University almost certainly will also become a\ncenter of research in learning thJory and curriculum\ndevelopment, thus functioning in accord with the\npredominant British definition of Educational Tech-\nnology. No one inthe Instituteof Educational\n'Technology, an integral part of the Open University\nstructure, seems primarily interested in machines or\ngadgetry.Sincequestionsof purpose,process,\nprocedure, and substance predominate, the Institute\nmight be called more accurately an institute of\neducational research.a\nBOU's Audience\nThe Open University is a unique institution in other\nways. To begin with, it operates an open admissions\npolicy (as its name indicates) in e country characterized\nby a very selective educational structure. In a society\nwhere fess than 2% of the population goes on to colleges\nand universities, it provides an opportunity to those who\nare deni^d access to higher education in its traditional\nforms.\nIn fact, the idee for the Open University first came into\nthe British public eye as a vote-appeel device for the\nLabor Party in 1963 and es a recognition that the primary\nfactor differentiating college from non-college youth is\noften class, not intelligence.\nIts political origins do not detrect from the fact that it is\nan important solution to a very real social need. The\nproof is in -4;1 numbers. When it opened, in 1971, there\nwere 43,000 applicants. Since then, the numbers have\nswelled to a total current enrollment of 64,000\nundergraduates and \"post-experience\" students; at\nthat, in the past year in many of the foundation courses it\nwas necessary to turn away four applicants for every\nnew one enrolled.\n2\n4,"

        "content": "The University is aimed primarily at students over age\n21. It provides a chance for people who are fully\nemployed to obtain a bachelor's degree. For those\nalready qualified, it offers the chance to update, retrain.\nand enhance professional skills. Most individuals who\nenroll do so to improve their job status. For examMe.\nabout 20% of the students are teachers who can\nincrease their chances for advancement by obtaining a\n4-year degree. (At present, there are roughly a quarter of\na million teachers in Britainmore than half the total\nwho have less than 4-year certification. Thus, their\nchances of promotion and higher salaries are limited.)\nAbout 50% of the students are women.\nThe University, sold to the taxpayers as an institution\nfor the working class. has been heavily middle class.\nBlue collar workers comprise less than 10% of the\nenrollment, but their actual number has increased\nslightly each year.\nThe University is made known through newspaper ads\nand articles, and through responses to direct mail\ninquiries. There is some hesitation to promote it further\nsince budget cuts have reduced the potential for\naccepting new students. But people come across shows\non BBC television and radio which prompt inquiries and\nthereis word-of-mouth communication about the\nprogram. Studies show that about half of the total\npopulation and nearly 100% of the teachers in England\nknow about it.\nCurriculum: Traditions and Innovations\nThe thrust of the curriculum is to offer a program\ncomparable to the BA. degree offerings in all British\nuniversities. A significant departure, however, is that\nmuch of a student's work is devoted to foundation\ncourses which make a deliberate attempt to interrelate\nknowledge.\nNevertheless, traditional patterns remain pervasive:\nthe curriculum is structured by the institution. Once a\nmajor field is chosen, the student is told what to study\nand how to study it, and tests and grades are intrinsic to\nthe scene. Thus, aside from the course approach which\nattemptstointegrateotherwisecompartmented\nknowledge, the chief departures from tradition lie in the\nadult audience served, the part-time option, the self-\npacing mode (within the limits of the weekly units), and\nthe sophisticated design of courses based on the\nprinciples of educational technology.\nThere are six broad fields of study: humanities,\nmathematics, science,socialscience, educational\nstudies, and technology. To obtain a degree, the student\nneeds six course credits; for the honors degree, eight\ncourse credits. (A course may be interpreted as roughly\nsimilar to our conventional academic program of six to\nnine credits per term.) These courses are divided into\nblocks of 4 to 5 weeks, and then into units of a single\nweek's work. Each week's unit requires a minimum of\nabout 10 hours of work: six hours of self instruction, a\nhalf hour of 1V, a half hour of radio, a half hour of self-\nassessment tests, about a half hour for subjective\nassignments to be graded by tutors, an hour of objective\nassignments to be graded by computer, and in science\nand technology, about an hour for home experiments.\nThe foundation courses in all disciplines are offered\neach year, along with courses on the second, third, and\nfourthlevels.Atpresent,therearealmost 70\nundergraduate course offerings.\nA student may take a maximum of two courses\n(gaining two credits) per year, and a B.A. can be obtained\nin three years, although a student following this line\nwould need to spend, at the very least, about 20 hours\neach week on studies. At the rate at which students are\npresently taking courses, the average time to achieve a\nB.A. degree is five years.\nCourses begin in early January of each year and\ncontinue for 32 weeks. This timetable allows the\nUniversitytoschedule one weekofobligatory\nattendance by Open University students in school and\ncollage spaces which are vacant in the summer. In\naddition, it gives the University access to academic\npersonnel.\nA graceful note is a policy of including a provisional\nregistration period of three months before students\nmust commit themselves to a full year's work and to the\nfull fees. This is in recognition tthe fact that many\nlearners need a kind of trial period to determine if the\nstudies are suitable for them.\nStudy Materials and Support Activities\nEssentially, the Open University rest* -011 corres-\npondence courses supplemented by brosNching.\nBut its planners, knowing that passivity anu isolation\ncan place a deadly pall on learning, employ a strategy\ndevised to counteract these potentially lethal elements\nwhich are present in any external study program. It is a\npattern calculated both to actively engage the learner\nwhile studying aloneand to bring them in touch with\neach other.\nAt the core of the program are the mailed weekly\npackages of printed materials. These contain carefully\nprepared and well-produced paper-bound texts. (These\nmaterials, prepared by BOU staff, are of high quality. The\nscience reader and other works have been accepted by\nmany traditional universities as approved texts, and are\nsold in book stores as well.P The printed materials also\nrefer students to outside readings and are coupled with\nnumerous written and practical exercises and tests.\nSome of the tests are scored by th N students themselves,\nsoma are sent to tutors for scoring and comment, and\nPlanning for Higher Education Vol. 4, No.2: 3/5 April 1975.6Society for College and University Planning, 3 Washington Square Village,\nSuite 1 -A, New York, New York 10012.

These\ncenters have a number of functions. One of the most\nimportant is to provide a place for student interaction.\nThe centers offer the sole opportunity for students to\nexchange experience, discuss problems, and explore\nideas with each other.\nAnother function is to make possible the face-to-face\ncontact of students with counsellors and tutors: Each\ncenter is supervised by a counsellor whose job it is to\nprovide advice, lead discussions after broadcasts, and\nmatch students with subject tutors who come at regular\nintervals to help students with special problems. There\nis no compulsory attendance. Students go when they\nlike but on nights when tutors are present, the\nattendance rate is much higher.\nThe local centers provide access to broadcasts for\nstudents who are outside the transmission area.

Some may have video\nplayback recorders, audio cassettes, or a super 8\ncartridge color projector. Every BBC program is copied\non film and a library of these films is maintained in the\ncenters. A complete set of radio tapes andprinted course\nmaterials is not uncommon. Half the centers have\ncomputer terminals for the students in the math and\ntechnology programs. Most terminals are linked to large\ncentral computers by standard telephone and telegraph\nlines.\nThe local centers themselvas are situated in found\nspaceusually a few rented classrooms in a college.\nThe space is not shared with any part of the program of\nthe building in which it is located: nothing is done to\ndistinguishit as the \"Open University.\" With the\nexceptionof the equipment and minimal storage\nfacilities, the space tends to be used as found. Some\nobservers have noted that the formal setting (row-type\nseating, hard surfaces, constant lighting, etc.) of the\nrented classroomsisnotconducive toinformal\ndiscussions. A further unfortunate result of the use of\nfound space is that when the traditional colleges close\nfor holidays, the Open University students have no place\nto meet.\nTeachers and Course Production\nProfessors are drawn from the ranks of British\nacademic institutions; the plan has been that most will\nserve on the Open University faculty for several years\nbefore returning to their own or other institutions.\nThe BBC f unctionsas a close partner in the enterprise.\nIt produces all the Open University's audio and video\ntapes for broadcast and cassettes (on a fixed cost\ncontract). Its Controller of Educational Broadcasting is a\nmember of the University Council and more than a dozen\nof its people are members of the University Senate.\nCourses are produced by instructional design teams\nmade up of professors, instructional designers from the\nInstituteofEducational Technology, andradio/\ntelevisionproducers from the BBC. A teamis\nresponsible for everything connected with the course:\ncontent, production, printed unitsall of the materials\nand things of learning. Thus, technology is system-\natically applied in the total context of instruction: one\nmedium is weighed against another and selected on the\nbasis of what makes the most sense for a given\nteaching/learning objective and the environment in\nwhich it will be used.\nThe Integration of the Media\nThe various myna are wedded so that the sum is\ngreater than the parts, as explained by illustrations from\n. courses themselves:\nIn some subject areas, telecast programs are vital\nfor performing assignments in the printed corres-\npondence texts. Typically, in science courses, students\nare asked to turn to a page in the text and to enter\ninstrument readings and other responses. The course\nmaterials are designed with deliberate gaps to be filled\nfrom information presented in the telecasts. Students\noutside the transmission area would have difficulty do-\ning the required work for credit in science if no provision\nwere made for them through film and audio tape replay\nfacilities at the study centers.\nIn another science program, atmospheric pollution\nreadings taken by several thousand students all over the\ncountry are collated and discussed. References are\nmade to correspondence materials,to the home\nexperiment kits, and to the correlated radio program of\nthe prior week. In this kind of telecast, last minute\nproduction allows the results of the survey to be\ncommunicated to students while the topic is still hot and\nrelevant to their studies.\nAnother approach demonstrates the joining of TV,\nradio, books, and audio tapes. A unit in the humanities\nfoundation course deals with the method and structure\nof D.H. Lawrence's novel, The Rainbow, and with\nLawrence's criticism of industrial society. Students read\nthe book with the help of a study guide. For background,\nthey view a well-produced TV documentary of the\n\"Civilization\" type. The radio program for the week is a\ngeneral talk about personal relationships in the book,\nand is accompanied by an extract from a recording of\nBertrandRussell'smemoriesofLawrence. The\ncorrespondencematerial'scontainextractsfrom\nLawrence's Twilight in Italy.\nLearning about computing, an essential part of\nmathematics courses,isfacilitated by television.\nStudents are often apprehensive about using the\nterminals for the first time, so the university has\nprepared two television programs to introduce them to\nthe experience. In the first, students are told about the\nkeyboard and how the terminal is linked to a central\ncomputer. In the second, they are shown how to try out\nthe machine.\nIn a social science course, \"Decision-Making in\nBritain,\"studentsareaskedtointerviewlocal\nindustrialists. For many, this is a difficult task. Before\nthey do it, they view a TV program inwhich two students\ntalk about how they did the work and how they felt about\nit.\nIn contrast to television programs which need\nextensive production facilities and are usually prepared\nfar in advance of a broadcast, radio can be used on short\nnotice, Feedback from tutors on difficulties students are\nhaving are incorporated into quick response radio\nbroadcasts. Radio is also used for the music included in\nthe humanities courses.\nRe-use of Courses.\nCourses are planned to be used several times, but\nprofessors who participate in the development of any\ncourse have the opportunity to alter parts of recorded\nprograms.

As the\nmainstay of the curriculum, the foundation courses are\nthe most frequently revised.\nOpen University materials have been so highly\nacclaimed that there has been much interest in their use\nby American institutions seeking to extend learning\nopportunities. In the fall of 1972 selected foundation\ncourses were imported to three American institutions\nthe University of Houston, University of Maryland, and\nRutgersfor a one-year trial to test their appropriate-\nness for American students. Now, there are more than\n20 American institutions offering Open University\nprograms either as a part of a course or as a complete\ncourse.'\nStudent Performance\nWhile it is still too early to look at student performance\nin relation to degrees awarded and the time it takes to do\nso, it is known that there is a 10% to 25% drop-out of\nfirst-year students. Data on students who enrolled in the\nfoundation courses the first time they were offered\nshow that 85% passed the examinations in the\nhumanities, 80% in the social sciences, 70% in science,\nand 60% in mathematics. As compared with other\nremotestudyprograms,theretentionrateis\nexceptionally high.\nCentral University Facilities\nAllmanagement operations emanate from an\nadministrative center located near the new town of\nMilton Keynes, about an hour from London. The main\nbuilding is in an old but renovated manor house known\nas Walton Hall, which serves as the center of the\nphysical complex. The surrounding buildings, designed\nas permanent construction, were built at considerable\ncost. They contain faculty offices together with a library,\nlaboratories, meeting rooms, and dining facilities: a\npublications unit, a data processing unit; and a mail\nhandling unit, including an official post office.\nI\n1\nf\n\"Somehow,\" observed one American architect\nreturning from the center, \"the fixed nature of these\ntraditionally designed facilities seems incongruous with\nthe dynamic nature of the Open University concept.\"\nIn addition to the full-timestaff of some 450\nacademics at the central headquarters, there at 1,500\npart-time counsellors and 3,000 tutors. Fifteen hundred\nfull-time administrative and clerical workers at both the\ncentral headquarters and regional centers provide\nmanagerial and support services.\nCosts\nThe capital costs of establishing the Open University\nwere about $12 million. Annual operating costs have\nincreased from year to year as enrollments and\nprograms have grown, starting with $8.8 million and\nnow reaching $41 million. The cost to the student is just\nunder $550 for an entire degree program. (Many\nstudents are reimbursed, however, sometimes totally.\nThe local education authorities are legally obliged to\nprovide educational opportunities; where they do not\noperatelocalprograms,they assumefinancial\nresponsibility for students who must go elsewhere,\nMany employersalsocontributevoluntarilyto\nreimbursement of tuitions.)\nOf the annual budget, about 22% is assigned to\nproduction of radio and television programs. The\nproduction cost of each IV program averages out to\nabout $12,750, excluding the salaries of academic staff\nand transmission costs, Production cost of each radio\nprogram is about $700. Total costs for correspondence\ntexts, and salaries for tutors and counsellors amount to\nroughly the same as the radio and IV production costs\nper year-22%.\nComparative costs are difficult to ascertain but the\nfollowing two samples indicate the nature of the cost\ndifferential between Open University courses and their\ntraditional counterparts.

For\nan Open University advanced level physics course, the\ncost ranged between 8350 and 8500 compared to\n81600 in a traditional campus setting. Even if the\naverage Open University student spends twice as long\nobtaining the degree, the cost of educating each Open\nUniversity student is one-fourth to one-third that of\neducating a student in the traditional fashion.\nGraduation day for a typical British Open University\nstudent: a young mother.\nElements of Success\nThough the Open University is only now in its fourth\nyea of operation. certain features are considered to be\nsignificant factors in its success thus far:\nTotal commitment to a full college degree program\nis backed by government funding for production,\ndelivery, and evaluation (as compared to Chicago TV\nCollege which is but one segment of a larger community\ncollege system and which has to share its budget\naccordingly).\nThe local study centers make possible personal\ncontact between students and counsellors, who\nencourage them through difficult times, and between\nstudents and tutors. who offer remedial assistance. In\naddition, the student interaction in tutorial groups\ncombines intellectual and social stimuli with mutual\nhelp. This has helped to prevent the attrition in initial\nenrollments. which tends to be substantial in remote\nstudies.\nThe strategy of using instructional design teams to\nintegrate all the varied components in each course\nmakes for well articulated, unified learning units. (The\nexistence of the Institute of Educational Technology is\nimportantinthisregard. The Instituteprovides\ncurriculum leadership and a staff devoted exclusively to\nstructuring the design of courses. Experts of this type are\nnot generally present on American campuses.)\n7\nThe close partnership of the BBC through its\norganizational integration in the governing council of\nthe University makes its expertise fully available.\nSophisticated professional production of television\nandradio programs makes them appealing and\ncompetitive with commercial broadcasting.\nThe respected quality of the published materials.\nwhich has made them widely available through\ntraditionalbookstoreoutlets,contributestothe\nrecognition and acceptance of the Open University.\nProblemsor Potential Problems\nDespite the most careful planning, weak spots in the\ngrand design of any new venture, especially one of this\nmagnitude, begin to emerge as the enterpriseis\nsubjected to the trial of everyday operations. Some of the\nmore visible ones relate to educational technology\nThere is a lack of flexibility in an integrated multi-\nmedia system which is paced on a week-to-week basis.\nThe very scheduling abroadcastsdemandsattention at\nthe times they are offered. It is true that students can\nmake up missed programs at the study centers, but the\nburden rests on them to make the effort. Moreover, the\nweekly programs move ahead inexorably and those who\nfall behind have trouble catching up.\nThough television and radio are vital components of\nthe learning experience, there is a question as to\nwhether their high cost has been completely justified.\nThe academic staff claims that it spends half its time on\nthe broadcasting component in contrast with the\nstudent who spends about 10% with k. There is as yet no\nevidence that the amount of time and money spent on\ntelevision and radio adds substantially to the student's\nlearning.\nThe complex distribution of the Open University's\npublished materials makes it extremely dependent on\nthe postal system. On average, 10-16,000 packages are\nmailed out each week in 1973, a total of 3.6 million\npackages were dispatched. The postal strike in 1971\nnearly created havoc and could do so again.\nFinally, some critics charge that the technological\ncapacity of the Open University is used for doing an old\nthing in a new way. In their view, too much time is spent\non the delivery of facts, and toolittle on teething ways to\nthink and to deal with facts. These critics regard the\nmedia as tools which must be used much more fully to\nstimulate initiative and to share experience.\nFor further information, write to Open University of\nthe United Kingdom.
